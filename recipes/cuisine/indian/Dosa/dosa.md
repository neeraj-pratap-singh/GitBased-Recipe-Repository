Certainly! Here's a classic South Indian Dosa recipe:

**Ingredients:**

For the Dosa Batter:
- 1 cup rice (any variety, preferably parboiled)
- 1/4 cup urad dal (skinned black gram)
- 1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)
- Water for soaking
- Salt to taste

For Making Dosas:
- Dosa batter (from above)
- Oil or ghee for cooking

**Instructions:**

**Preparing the Dosa Batter:**

1. Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water until the water runs clear.

2. In two separate bowls, soak the rice and urad dal (and fenugreek seeds, if using) in enough water to cover them completely. Allow them to soak for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight.

3. After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal.

4. In a blender, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds (if used) with enough water to form a smooth and fluffy batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. Transfer this batter to a large mixing bowl.

5. Next, grind the rice with enough water to create a slightly coarse batter. It should have the consistency of fine semolina. Add this batter to the bowl with the urad dal batter.

6. Mix the two batters together thoroughly. Add salt to taste and mix again. The batter should be thick but pourable. Add water if necessary to achieve the right consistency.

7. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for at least 8 hours or overnight. During fermentation, the batter will rise and become slightly airy.

**Making Dosas:**

1. Heat a non-stick skillet or a dosa pan over medium-high heat. You can lightly grease the pan with oil or ghee.

2. Once the pan is hot, pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the pan.

3. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even dosa. Make it as thin or thick as you prefer.

4. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and on top if desired.

5. Cook the dosa until the edges turn golden brown and crisp, and the center is cooked through. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.

6. Gently lift the dosa using a spatula and fold it in half or roll it up, then transfer it to a serving plate.

7. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more oil or ghee to the pan as needed.

**To Serve:**

- Serve dosas hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or any other dipping sauce of your choice.

Enjoy your homemade Dosas! They are delicious and can be filled with various fillings if you prefer, such as potato masala or cheese.
